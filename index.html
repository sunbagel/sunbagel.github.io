        <h2 class="message">Introduction:</h2>
            <p class="analyze">The Deep End is meant to be a collection of poems that draw on my own personal insecurities and worries.
                Each of my poems are related to each other through the theme of loneliness, and are connected through the references to coding. 
                They tackle different aspects of my character and gradually, they build on each other and come to a resolution in my final poem 
                “while(i am alone)”.

                at the crack of dawn <br>
                a crashing wave awoke <br>

        <h2 class="message">Message:</h2>
            
            <p class="message1">at the crack of dawn is meant to be a poem about my attitude towards things that seem beyond me or appear as a challenge. 
                Often, I can’t always deal with them by myself, and that can create problems for me in the future, or even other people.
            </p>

            <p class="analyze">To demonstrate this, I used rather cacophonous diction (crashing, wake, crack, hard k’s). 
                It shows the rather abrupt and sudden rush of the wave (the challenge), and emphasizes a sense of “rude awakening”. 
                I also used puns, and played on the word wake, using it in many different contexts such as; awake, a wake (disturbed flow of water), and the wake (aftermath). 
                This was used mostly in the sense to potentially confuse the reader, once again flooding them with a wealth of interpretations, and representing the very sudden and confusing wave. 
                In this poem, connotative diction was also used as the crashing wave was meant to be interpreted as crashing (like a computer program). 
                While individually, it doesn’t make too much sense, in the context of the rest of my anthology, there are many references to coding (jargon, concepts etc.).

            <p class="message1">If this is your first time reading this poem, go back, 
                and highlight the entirety of "a comment" with your mouse (there should be 16 lines in total).

            <p class="message1">My message for this part of my anthology is how I often reserve my thoughts, 
                and don’t know how to express myself, even though most of the time, it would be beneficial to me or others.
            </p>
             <p class="analyze">To show this, I used programming jargon (more specifically, Java) with the use of the // before every invisible line.
                  In Java, this represents a comment on the code, so something that isn’t actually read by the program but is meant as a tool for the programmer to read and use as notes, next-steps or to organize their program better.
                   This is an analogy for how not everything that I express is what I feel, or think. Just like how the comments are shown only to the programmer, my thoughts are shown only to me.

            <p class="message1">The main theme I tried to convey in while(i am alone) is the theme of loneliness. 
                Personally, I find that I often struggle to communicate in new environments, and that without a familiar face 
                or friend it's difficult to find my place. 
             </p>
             <p class="message1">One way I decided to show this was by using repetition. 
                 The reason I found this to be effective (and also the reason I used the Meeting Point as my inspiration) 
                 was because by repeating lines, I could imitate the feeling of being in a loop, and stuck in place.
            </p>
            <p class="message1"> I also formatted my poem to cater to this by making most of it a “while loop”, a concept in Java
                 where whatever is in the curly brackets ({}) will repeat, until the condition (whatever is in brackets in the very 
                 beginning-in this case, the “i am alone”) is made false. 
            </p>
            <p class="analyze">Another way I decided to show my message was through sentence structure. Before the while loop ends, 
                each line is chopped up, and relatively “blocky”, still and unmoving. However after the while loop ends, each line 
                becomes more free flowing, with the sentence continuing on to the next line. This is to show the breaking of the loop, 
                and represents the movement forward.

        <h2 class="message">My Interpretation:</h2>
        <h2 class="subinterpret">Literal Message:</h2>
            <p class="message1">The Meeting Point is a poem about two people meeting, and going on a date. You can find evidence of this from the many references that the poet makes. </p>

            <p class="message1"> For example, in the line “And two people with the one pulse”, it offers an image of two hearts in sync with another two people in love. </p>
                    
            <p class="message1"> In the first and the fourth stanzas, you can find descriptions of cutlery; </p>
                    
            <p class= "message1"> “There were two glasses and two chairs” and “That stretched around the cups and plates;” </p>
                    
            <p class="message1">The second stanza also mentions that they are in a coffee shop, which would be a suitable place for a date, or at the very least a meet-up. </p>
        
        <h2 class="subinterpret">Message:</h2>

            <p class="message1">The message of this poem is that falling in love is magical, and it can feel as if time is away, and it’s just you and them. 
                The worries and feelings of the outside world seem to fall away. I interpreted the poem this way because it has a heavy emphasis on the senses (such as moving, feeling, and hearing) disappearing.
                 For example, it mentions a bell, silent in the air. This shows the stillness of life, and the absence of time, as bells usually mark the passing of time, such as in a clock (ringing every hour). 
            </p>

        <h2 class="subinterpret">Tone:</h2>

            <p class="message1">The tone of this poem is mystical, light-hearted and optimistic in mood. </p>

        <h2 class="subinterpret">Diction:</h2>

            <p class="message1">This is supported by the abstract and imaginative diction which adds to the euphoric and magical feel of the poem. 
                It offers the reader an image of what it’s like to be in love-something that would be hard to describe with more literal language.
            </p>
            <p class="message1">For example, the most repetitive line “Time was away and somewhere else” and phrases such as “The bell was silent in the air” 
                are used in such a way that they give a surreal image of the experience. Everything has essentially stopped.
            </p>
            <p class="message1">Another example would be the line “And two people with the one pulse”.
                This would be something that you would have to look at more creatively to understand. 
                It offers the reader an image of two people, sharing the same heartbeat, and giving the message of being in love.
            </p>

        <h2 class="subinterpret">Repetition</h2>

            <p class="message1">Another literary device that can be found is the use of repetition. 
                This is most prominent at the beginning and the end of each stanza, and is used to emphasize the 
                feeling of a loop, or of time being stopped (fitting to the theme of the poem). 
            </p>
            <p class="message1">The poet also uses the line “Time was away and somewhere else” in the beginning and middle portions 
                of the poem, and the line “Time was away and she was here” for the final stanza. This points out to the reader that 
                time truly was away, and that the same moments were being experienced, stuck and ever unchanging. By making the final 
                phrase slightly different from the others, the poet also draws the poem to its end with one final point. Time was no 
                longer there, and “she was here” (presumably the significant other). This contrasts with the previous two lines, where 
                time was away and somewhere else, while she was here, present and with them
            </p>

        <h2 class="subinterpret">Effect:</h2>
            
            <p class="message1">Personally, this poem had an interesting effect on me. The language the poet used was very colourful and 
                imaginative, and the poem drew me into the dreamlike environment. It let me see a new perspective of being in love, and 
                experience the feeling of being seemingly frozen in time.

            <p class="analyze">The Meeting Point uses a ABCBA format, with the first line repeating at the very end, and the second line 
                rhyming with the fourth. In this poem, this format is used to show the stopping of time, and I wanted to also convey the 
                stopping of time in my poem (although in a different context), so I decided to base my inspired poem off of it.
